The MCP should prioritize simplicity: minimal setup, fast command turnaround, and clear visibility into stdout/stderr/exit codes so the AI can safely automate routine server-side tasks.\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\nEven without formal steering docs, this effort advances the broader goal of enabling AI-first ops workflows. A centralized remote-command MCP reduces human context switching, shortens feedback loops for remote debugging or deployments, and lays the groundwork for future governance hooks once stricter controls are needed.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1: Remote command execution\n\n**User Story:** As an AI operator, I want to run arbitrary shell commands on a chosen remote server so that I can perform development, deployment, and maintenance actions without manually SSH-ing.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the AI invokes the `runCommand` tool with a target host alias and command text THEN the MCP SHALL establish a session over the configured transport (default: SSH) and return stdout, stderr, and exit code in the response payload.\n2. IF the MCP cannot open the remote connection (e.g., host unreachable, auth failure) THEN it SHALL respond with a structured error containing the root cause and SHALL NOT attempt to run the command.\n3. WHEN a command exceeds the configured timeout AND no streaming output has been sent THEN the MCP SHALL terminate the remote process and flag the timeout in the result so the AI can decide whether to retry.\n4. WHEN the AI requests output streaming for long-running commands THEN the MCP SHALL relay incremental stdout/stderr chunks in-order until completion or timeout.\n\n### Requirement 2: Server configuration and session control\n\n**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want to define remote environments (aliases, addresses, credentials, default shells) in a single config so the AI can reliably target the right machines without handling raw secrets.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the MCP loads or reloads its configuration file THEN each server definition SHALL include alias, host, port, username, auth strategy (SSH key, agent, etc.), and optional default working directory.\n2. IF a configuration entry is missing required fields or references unavailable credentials THEN the MCP SHALL refuse to start (or hot-reload) and emit actionable validation errors.\n3. WHEN multiple commands target the same host concurrently THEN the MCP SHALL maintain isolated sessions (separate PTYs or exec channels) so outputs do not interleave.\n4. WHEN configuration changes on disk THEN the MCP SHALL provide a reload mechanism (command or signal) so updates take effect without a full process restart.\n\n### Requirement 3: Execution telemetry and future guardrail hooks\n\n**User Story:** As an SRE lead, I want an audit trail and extension points so we can review what the AI executed and later plug in policy enforcement without redesigning the MCP.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN any command starts or finishes THEN the MCP SHALL log timestamp, host alias, command summary, exit status, and duration to a local log sink.\n2. IF logging fails (e.g., disk full) THEN the MCP SHALL surface warnings but continue serving commands while signaling degraded observability.\n3. WHEN the AI invokes `runCommand` THEN the MCP SHALL evaluate optional pre- and post-execution hooks (no-ops for now) that can later enforce whitelists, confirmations, or notifications.\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n- Respect single-responsibility: transport adapters, configuration loaders, command executors, and logging should live in distinct modules with minimal coupling.\n- Provide clear interfaces for transports so SSH today can coexist with future agents or cloud APIs.\n\n### Performance\n- Median command startup latency (request to remote exec) SHOULD be under 2 seconds on LAN connections.\n- Support at least 5 concurrent command sessions without observable slowdown.\n\n### Security\n- Use SSH keys or OS keychains for auth; secrets SHALL NOT be stored in plaintext within the repo.\n- Provide configuration knobs for known_hosts verification and strict host key checking.\n- Keep guardrail hooks pluggable so future policy modules can inspect or veto commands before execution.\n\n### Reliability\n- Implement retry/backoff for transient SSH failures before surfacing errors.\n- Enforce sane defaults for timeouts to avoid runaway processes; ensure terminated commands clean up remote sessions.\n\n### Usability\n- Define a human-readable config format (e.g., YAML/TOML) with documentation so developers can add hosts quickly.\n- Return errors with actionable remediation hints (bad key path, DNS failure, etc.) to reduce trial-and-error.\n",
